# Distribution

block.tranqol-duct-junction.name = Duct Junction
block.tranqol-duct-junction.description = Acts as a junction between two crossing ducts.

# Liquid

block.tranqol-liquid-overflow-valve.name = Liquid Overflow Valve
block.tranqol-liquid-overflow-valve.description = Only outputs liquid to the left and right if the front path is blocked.
block.tranqol-liquid-underflow-valve.name = Liquid Underflow Valve
block.tranqol-liquid-underflow-valve.description = Opposite of an overflow gate. Outputs to the front if the left and right paths are blocked.

block.tranqol-liquid-unloader.name = Liquid Unloader
block.tranqol-liquid-unloader.description = Unloads the selected liquid from nearby blocks.
block.tranqol-liquid-unloader.details = Sprite by KayAyeAre#7145

# Payload

block.tranqol-payload-junction.name = Payload Junction
block.tranqol-payload-junction.description = Acts as a junction between two crossing payload conveyors.
block.tranqol-payload-junction.details = Don't ask how this even works in the first place.
block.tranqol-reinforced-payload-junction.name = Reinforced Payload Junction
block.tranqol-reinforced-payload-junction.description = Acts as a junction between two crossing payload conveyors.
block.tranqol-payload-rail.name = Payload Rail
block.tranqol-payload-rail.description = Ferries large payloads overhead, such as units from factories. Magnetic. Usable in zero-G environments.

# Power

block.tranqol-smart-power-node.name = Smart Power Node
block.tranqol-smart-power-node.description = Transmits power to connected nodes. The node will receive power from or supply power to any adjacent blocks.\nBeam color is randomized based on the graph id.
block.tranqol-smart-beam-node.name = Smart Beam Node
block.tranqol-smart-beam-node.description = Transmits power to other blocks orthogonally. Stores a small amount of power.\nBeam color is randomized based on the graph id.
block.tranqol-beam-insulator.name = Beam Insulator
block.tranqol-beam-insulator.description = Blocks connection between beam nodes. Can be opened and closed to toggle connections.
block.tranqol-beam-diode.name = Beam Diode
block.tranqol-beam-diode.description = Transmits battery power orthogonally in one direction, but only if the receiving side has less power stored.
